      <p> The aim of this work is to celebrate where I’ve been and what I have left to do. I’ve wanted to have some catalog of my loc journey for some time, and have been recording its progress monthly for some time. I figured to combine that with my love for beetles, as they’re noteworthy for rapid growth. And do note that it’s pronounced “Black Beetles”, and not “Black ‘ecks’ Beetles or “Black cross Beetles”. I can’t stop you from mispronouncing it but. C’mon.</p>
